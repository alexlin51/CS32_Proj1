2. We are not able to insert the Coord object into our set due to not implementing a way to checking the <, >, == operators for a Coord object. When inserting any object into our Set, we first compare the object we want to insert with the objects already within the Set. This is to ensure that when adding new objects, the order of the Set remains decending. Because our Coord class is custom and doesn't provide an implementation of how to compare two Coord objects, when inserting into our Set, this will cause our program to throw an error.
