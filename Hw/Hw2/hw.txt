The two algorithms differ from each other in the order they search; the stack used depth first searching while the queue used breadth first.
Because the stack accesses coordinate in a last in, first out fashion, we search the maze by running down a path until we reach a wall or endpoint, then we would continue traversing new paths from the last intersection. 
Because the queue accesses coordinates in a first in, first out fashion, we move one step forward in all directions each iteration to explore branches/paths until the path reached a dead end.
